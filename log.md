# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 29

**Today's Progress**: Started buildling upon my basic HTML5 skills, and started completely new with CSS. Learnt how to assign font families, border sizes etc. Created checkboxes and radio boxes on the freecodecamp challenge.

**Thoughts:** I got through the challenges pretty quickly, but I tend to forget what I learnt in previous challenges. Hoping that practice will drum that into me.

### Day 2: May 30

**Today's Progress**: Started over with JavaScript. More challenging than HTML but most of it seems logical, and I'm looking forward to getting into the grittier stuff. Not sure if there's a bug on FCC as I had to keep on refreshing it to get it to run the test. Anyway, I posted for help on the forum.


**Thoughts:** I got stuck for ages on the escape sequence in strings part, which I found frustrating as I'm sure I followed the instructions carefully. Little deflated as I hate admitting defeat, but these things take time.
