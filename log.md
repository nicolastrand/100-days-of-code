# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 29

**Today's Progress**: Started buildling upon my basic HTML5 skills, and started completely new with CSS. Learnt how to assign font families, border sizes etc. Created checkboxes and radio boxes on the freecodecamp challenge.

**Thoughts:** I got through the challenges pretty quickly, but I tend to forget what I learnt in previous challenges. Hoping that practice will drum that into me.
