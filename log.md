# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 29

**Today's Progress**: Started buildling upon my basic HTML5 skills, and started completely new with CSS. Learnt how to assign font families, border sizes etc. Created checkboxes and radio boxes on the freecodecamp challenge.

**Thoughts:** I got through the challenges pretty quickly, but I tend to forget what I learnt in previous challenges. Hoping that practice will drum that into me.

### Day 2: May 30

**Today's Progress**: Started over with JavaScript. More challenging than HTML but most of it seems logical, and I'm looking forward to getting into the grittier stuff. Not sure if there's a bug on FCC as I had to keep on refreshing it to get it to run the test. Anyway, I posted for help on the forum.


**Thoughts:** I got stuck for ages on the escape sequence in strings part, which I found frustrating as I'm sure I followed the instructions carefully. Little deflated as I hate admitting defeat, but these things take time.

### Day 3: May 31

**Today's Progress**: Thanks to the help of the FCC community, I figured out the problem I had yesterday and I've definitely learnt something. Need to keep an eye on the details. I only did 35 minutes tonight as I have been working since 8am this morning and my brain is mush, but I figured better 35 minutes of code than nothing and risk slipping off the bandwagon.

**Thoughts:**: Impatient. I mean, I feel better than I did yesterday about it - I guess the fresh(ish) mind to it helped. I'm really looking forward to starting on the stuff that'll help me with web analytics but it's so far away in the curriculum - must practice my patience!

### Day 4: June 01

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about indexes and arrays tonight, although had to stop as one of the tests is buggy. Thankfully was at the end of my hour, but I hope it's resolved by tomorrow so I can progress. I've also downloaded VS Coder so I can start to do stuff in situ, although I'll need tutorials. If FreeCodeCamp is still buggy tomorrow I'll look at VS Coder tutorials.

**Thoughts:**: Positive. One thing I'd like to see on FreeCodeCamp is examples of when these sorts of JavaScript would be used - the HTML practice was useful with the interactive Cat Photo App, not sure if something similar could be done for JS? Still, nothing better than my own project although I feel I still have a long way to go.

### Day 5: June 02

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp forum to the rescue again - had to adjust something above the line `"change your code below this line"` part to progress. But my code was right - woohoo!

**Thoughts:**: Positive, but feel I have a long way to go in terms of getting it engrained in my head. Practice will make perfect, but I'm soooo impatient! Also realised tonight why headphones and white noise are so useful - coding + distractions do not mmix!

### Day 6: June 03

**Today's Progress**: Tonight was a mix of moving forward, and starting to revise old modules. Got to lesson 53 where I needed to call upon stuff I'd already done, but I've already forgotten some so will go back and redo those so it sticks easier in my head. I also visited a Slack group where tag management is discussed a lot - can already find I understand even teeny bits of the code that's pasted, which is a good sign of progress. Also good to read about JS in situ.

**Thoughts:**: In all honesty, I was incredibly frustrated tonight. I had to get hints/help three lessons in a row as I got very stuck, particularly on lesson 53. But it's all part of the learning curve - some days I'll have bad days, and other days I'll make progress. Like with everything there'll come a time where things just click - but it's a long way away, understandably. Even when I don't feel like coding I will make myself push on - otherwise the habit will be broken and all my progress lost.

### Day 7: June 04

**Today's Progress**: Today I got to tackle Booleans, (in)equality operators and started on `if` statements, which I remember from Codecademy. Without wanting to sound arrogant, I flew through these - very logical, it reminded me of creating lookups in Excel. I got far today, although frustrating that my WiFi connection went down in the middle of my flow! 

**Thoughts:**: Massive confidence boost in comparison to yesterday's frustration. Maybe I'm more natural at this part of JavaScript? It's so logical to me. Gives me confidence that I'll get better with the other parts - all I need to do is practice. I think I even know when I would use this sort of command - six months ago I wouldn't have had a clue so I _am_ getting better, even if it's not obvious at the time.

### Day 8: June 05

**Today's Progress**: More work on `if` statements, then moved onto `else if` statements. It makes sense, although you have to be so accurate - sometimes even the omission of something tiny will cause the entire thing to not work. Tomorrow I will be moving onto switch statements which, if I remember correctly, will be able to replace the more complex `else if` statements.

**Thoughts:**: Feel about the same as yesterday about it. The more I do it, the more familiar I get (of course). Although I do tend to forget modules already covered, so I will take some time next tonight to revise a few modules I've already done, so I don't forget what certain functions do. All in all, feeling positive.

### Day 9: June 06

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about switch statements, objects, properties ...got up to the "Accessing Object Properties with Variables" module before calling it a day after one hour, as my head was getting fried. Biggest progress was remembering operators earlier in the process AND writing a switch statement from scratch without the example shown on the left. Proves that knowledge is sinking in and I'm not just c & p-ing.

**Thoughts:**: Positive! Also feel I'm starting to get to the parts which will really be useful for what I want to do with my career!

### Day 10: June 07

**Today's Progress**: Blergh. Had to refer to YouTube three times in four modules. Gave in 15 minutes early and asked the internet for help again. Back tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**: Really frustrating. On days like this I feel like I'm never going to get it. Hopefully tomorrow will be clearer!

### Day 11: June 11

**Today's Progress**: I'm back in it! Had to skip three days: two due to MeasureCamp planning/eventing and then a sick child yesterday, but back in the game tonight. Although today I didn't do freecodecamp, I instead played with GTM - this is the reason I want to learn JavaScript so I really hope that it still counts, even though I didn't do much 'actual' coding.

**Thoughts:**: I feel so-so. I feel good in the sense that the JavaScript I have learnt so far is helping me make sense of what was before a massive chunk of gobbledegook, but not so good in the sense that I still don't properly get it. Still - practice makes perfect.

### Day 12: June 12

**Today's Progress**: So today I revisited HTML and CSS as I want to start building my own forms. Got a couple of bootstrap templates and played around with the CSS in codepen - can't seem to get the font to a sans serif so will have to ask the internet for help there. Reason I want to do this is so I can practice my tag management in GTM.

**Thoughts:**: Well, the coding I didn't do well on technically BUT I found that I can read the stylesheets so much better now - it's no longer just a whole ton of code I can't read. Surely that's progress, even if I've slowed down in my own coding? BUT BUT BUT. I was just able to build my very first tag in GTM which I have never done before!

**Link to work:** nicolastrand.com (this is my website, you can inspect the page to see where I've put the tags). I'll start a project for a sign up form on Code Pen too at some point.

### Day 13: June 13

**Today's Progress**: Today, with the help of a YouTube tutorial and parts of a template I found online, I started a mini project on CodePen - a simple sign up form page. Only did the HTML and worked on my CSS, which to my surprise actually worked! Need to style more in the background but that part isn't important for what I want to do so I'll only do that if I need to (or if I feel like doing it for fun).

**Thoughts:**: Feel good about this, actually! The next thing I want to do is to add one more box and a button which appears UNCHECKED. This means I will need to add some JavaScript, which will be excellent practice. Will probably take a freaking age, but that's ok.

### Day 14: June 14

**Today's Progress**: No progress in terms of how my project looks, but progress in terms of learning what things DON'T do, which is still progress. Joined Stackoverflow and posted my first question. It's gonna be a long road, but hopefully worth it.

**Thoughts:**: Disappointed I didn't get to start on JavaScript elements, but I need to remember that I need to take baby steps with this. It took me six months to get over the hump with learning Danish - I can do this too.

### Day 15: June 15

**Today's Progress**: Zero. Waited for the nice people of Stackoverflow to get back to me.

**Thoughts:**: Feel ok. Not expecting to get everything overnight but yeah, it's a tiny bit frustrating.

### Day 16: June 16

**Today's Progress**: The gods of StackOverflow came through! I made huge progress for someone of my level today. Added radio buttons to my form, and was able to determine how to style them with CSS. Also went back to HTML5 module on freecodecamp to revise past modules.

**Thoughts:**: Feel good! There was one really great answer on StackOverflow which showed really clearly what I was missing, plus because people were so nice to me as a newbie, it gave me more encouragement to keep going. Only thing is, I'm not sure whether I'm doing the right thing continuing with HTML but I figure that it all helps in the end - I'll need to know that to know JavaScript.
